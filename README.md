# NLP_with_Disaster_tweets
Kaggle_NLP_challenge

This is an effort to categorize and classify `Real` disaster tweets from `Fake` ones. The data consists of location as one of the features and the text as another feature. I have just used the text or the tweet for the classification problem.I have used a regularized LSTM as my model for the classification task. The LSTM is regularised using drop-out. The model achieved a `validation accuracy of 0.80` on a decent sized data-set.

In a separate notebook,I have further explored the data-set by taking the location into account and exploring the top-10 most frequently mentinoned location for each category.
